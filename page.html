                The synoptic gospels consist of books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. These three gospels contain much of the same
                material. The books of Matthew and Luke tell nearly all of the stories told in Mark. Matthew and Luke also
                share several stories that are not in Mark. In addition, all three books are written as if the authors had
                personally observed all of the events and were reporting what they saw at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Gospel of John specifically omits much of the material found in the synoptic gospels. It also contains a
                considerable amount of material that is not found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It appears that John wrote his
                gospel as a supplement to the other gospels. Whether or not John actually had seen them is unknown, but it
                appears that he at least knew the contents of synoptic gospels. In the areas where John does tell of the same
                events, he tends to add information that is not in the other gospels. This may primarily be because the Gospel
                of John was written many years after the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. This is supported by the
                literary style used in John. The author is obviously telling the narrative looking back on the events in a
                more reflective style than the synoptic gospels. The contents of John also supports this view. For instance,
                in John's telling of the <a href="#TheAnointinginBethany">Anointing in Bethany</a> (John 12:1-8), John names Mary as the woman who anointed Jesus
                with nard. The synoptic gospels left the woman nameless, most likely to protect her. By the time
                that John wrote his gospel, the threat to her for being named would have past.
            </p>
            <p>
                Insights like these are why it is so important to study all of the gospels together. That is why we've put this site together, so you can study the life of Jesus with each gospel side-by-side.

Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <sup>7</sup>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. <sup>8</sup>For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. <sup>9</sup>The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) <sup>10</sup>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. <sup>11</sup>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water? <sup>12</sup>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? <sup>13</sup>Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again: <sup>14</sup>but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life. <sup>15</sup>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw. <sup>16</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. <sup>17</sup>The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: <sup>18</sup>for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly. <sup>19</sup>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. <sup>20</sup>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. <sup>21</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. <sup>22</sup>Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. <sup>23</sup>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers. <sup>24</sup>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth. <sup>25</sup>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things. <sup>26</sup>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <sup>27</sup>And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? <sup>28</sup>So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people, <sup>29</sup>Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ? <sup>30</sup>They went out of the city, and were coming to him. <sup>31</sup>In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat. <sup>32</sup>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not. <sup>33</sup>The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat? <sup>34</sup>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work. <sup>35</sup>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest. <sup>36</sup>He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. <sup>37</sup>For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. <sup>38</sup>I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor. <sup>39</sup>And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did. <sup>40</sup>So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days. <sup>41</sup>And many more believed because of his word; <sup>42</sup>and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</p></div>

                        <div class="span3 "><strong>John 5</strong><br /><p><sup>2</sup>Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches. <sup>3</sup>In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered. <sup>4</sup>for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden. <sup>5</sup>And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity. <sup>6</sup>When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole? <sup>7</sup>The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. <sup>8</sup>Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. <sup>9</sup>And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day. <sup>10</sup>So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed. <sup>11</sup>But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. <sup>12</sup>They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? <sup>13</sup>But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place. <sup>14</sup>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee. <sup>15</sup>The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole. <sup>16</sup>And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath. <sup>17</sup>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work. <sup>18</sup>For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <sup>19</sup>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. <sup>20</sup>For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel. <sup>21</sup>For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will. <sup>22</sup>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son; <sup>23</sup>that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him. <sup>24</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life. <sup>25</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live. <sup>26</sup>For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself: <sup>27</sup>and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man. <sup>28</sup>Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, <sup>29</sup>and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment. <sup>30</sup>I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. <sup>31</sup>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. <sup>32</sup>It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. <sup>33</sup>Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth. <sup>34</sup>But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved. <sup>35</sup>He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light. <sup>36</sup>But the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. <sup>37</sup>And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form. <sup>38</sup>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not. <sup>39</sup>Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me; <sup>40</sup>and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life. <sup>41</sup>I receive not glory from men. <sup>42</sup>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves. <sup>43</sup>I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. <sup>44</sup>How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not? <sup>45</sup>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, on whom ye have set your hope. <sup>46</sup>For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me. <sup>47</sup>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p></div>

He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing. <sup>8</sup>The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? <sup>9</sup>Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he. <sup>10</sup>They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened? <sup>11</sup>He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight. <sup>12</sup>And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not. <sup>13</sup>They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. <sup>14</sup>Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. <sup>15</sup>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. <sup>16</sup>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. <sup>17</sup>They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. <sup>18</sup>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight, <sup>19</sup>and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? <sup>20</sup>His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: <sup>21</sup>but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself. <sup>22</sup>These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. <sup>23</sup>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. <sup>24</sup>So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner. <sup>25</sup>He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. <sup>26</sup>They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? <sup>27</sup>He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples? <sup>28</sup>And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses. <sup>29</sup>We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is. <sup>30</sup>The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes. <sup>31</sup>We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth. <sup>32</sup>Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. <sup>33</sup>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing. <sup>34</sup>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. <sup>35</sup>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? <sup>36</sup>He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? <sup>37</sup>Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee. <sup>38</sup>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. <sup>39</sup>And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind. <sup>40</sup>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind? <sup>41</sup>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.</p></div>

If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. <sup>10</sup>But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him. <sup>11</sup>These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. <sup>12</sup>The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover. <sup>13</sup>Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep. <sup>14</sup>Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. <sup>15</sup>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. <sup>16</sup>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. <sup>17</sup>So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. <sup>18</sup>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off; <sup>19</sup>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. <sup>20</sup>Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house. <sup>21</sup>Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. <sup>22</sup>And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. <sup>23</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. <sup>24</sup>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. <sup>25</sup>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live; <sup>26</sup>and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this? <sup>27</sup>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, even he that cometh into the world. <sup>28</sup>And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee. <sup>29</sup>And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him. 30(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.) <sup>31</sup>The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there. <sup>32</sup>Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. <sup>33</sup>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, <sup>34</sup>and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see. <sup>35</sup>Jesus wept. <sup>36</sup>The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him! <sup>37</sup>But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die? <sup>38</sup>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <sup>39</sup>Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been dead four days. <sup>40</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God? <sup>41</sup>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me. <sup>42</sup>And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me. <sup>43</sup>And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. <sup>44</sup>He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p></div>

                        <div class="span3 "><strong>John 12</strong><br /><p><sup>12</sup>On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, <sup>13</sup>took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel. <sup>14</sup>And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, <sup>15</sup>Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt. <sup>16</sup>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. <sup>17</sup>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness. <sup>18</sup>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign. <sup>19</sup>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.</p></div>

And they murmured against her. <sup>6</sup>But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. <sup>7</sup>For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always. <sup>8</sup>She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying. <sup>9</sup>And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</p></div>

And he saith, Teacher, say on. <sup>41</sup>A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty. <sup>42</sup>When they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most? <sup>43</sup>Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. <sup>44</sup>And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. <sup>45</sup>Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. <sup>46</sup>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. <sup>47</sup>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. <sup>48</sup>And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. <sup>49</sup>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins? <sup>50</sup>And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p></div>
                        <div class="span3 "><strong>John 12</strong><br /><p><sup>1</sup>Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead. <sup>2</sup>So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him. <sup>3</sup>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. <sup>4</sup>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith, <sup>5</sup>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor? <sup>6</sup>Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein. <sup>7</sup>Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying. <sup>8</sup>For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.</p></div>

And they said, Barabbas. <sup>22</sup>Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ?
